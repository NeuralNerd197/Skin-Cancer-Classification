# Skin-Cancer-Classification
This project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify skin cancer types using the HAM10000 dataset. We implement hyperparameter tuning to obtain the best parameters for model training before leveraging these parameters to achieve optimal classification accuracy.
